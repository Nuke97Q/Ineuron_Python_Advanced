    "Q1. What is the purpose of Python's OOP?\n",
    "\n",
    "OOP is much simpler to understand and use in Python than in other languages, such as C++ or Java. As a dynamically typed scripting language, Python removes much of the syntactic clutter and complexity that clouds OOP in other tools. In fact, most of the OOP story in Python boils down to this expression: object.attribute\n",
    "Following are the advantages:\n",
    "1) Reusability of code\n",
    "2) Readability\n",
    "3) Concise"

    "\n",
    "Attribute fetches are simply tree searches. The term inheritance is applied because objects lower in a tree inherit attributes attached to objects higher in that tree. As the search proceeds from the bottom up, in a sense, the objects linked into a tree are the union of all the attributes defined in all their tree parents, all the way up the tree.\n",
    "Python really does climb this tree at runtime searching for attributes every time we use the object. attribute expression"
